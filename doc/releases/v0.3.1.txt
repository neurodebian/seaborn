v0.3.1 (April 2014)
-------------------

This is a minor release from 0.3 with fixes for several bugs.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The size of the points in pointplot and factorplot is now scaled with the linewidth for better aesthetics across different plotting contexts.

- The pointplot glyphs for different levels of the hue variable are drawn at different z-orders so that they appear uniform.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in FacetGrid (and thus affecting lmplot and factorplot) that appeared when ``col_wrap`` was used with a number of facets that did not evenly divide into the column width.

- Fixed an issue where the support for kernel density estimates was sometimes computed incorrectly.

- Fixed a problem where ``hue`` variable levels that were not strings were missing in FacetGrid legends.

- When passing a color palette list in a ``with`` statement, the entire palette is now used instead of the first six colors.
